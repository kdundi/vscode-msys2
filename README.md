# vscode-msys2
I recently started using vscode and was looking for a way to compile c++ for simple projects but most of the solutions
either required you to modify environment variables or jump through hoops to compile a simple c++ file. My other option was to do it
through command line. After digging around for a bit, I've put this together. I hope it helps someone else who might be looking for a
similar solution.


# Usage
Usage is simple, create a new tasks.json file by following: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks

Paste the code in your tasks.json file and you're all set.

# Note
If your msys2 location is in a different location than c:\msys64, you will need to modify the path to refect your installation location.
